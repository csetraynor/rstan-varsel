Projection predictive input variable selection using Stan+R
===========================================================

This repository contains simple example codes for performing projection predictive variable selection for linear regression models using Stan+R. The method is described in detail in the document. See also our comparative study for performance evaluation of the method (Piironen and Vehtari, 2015).


Example
-------
You should have RStan installed. Run first

    library(rstan)
    source('projection.R')

After that you can run one of the main scripts, either

    source('search.R')
    
or 

    source('search_cv.R')

Both of these will take some time to execute, but you can reduce the running time by reducing the number of samples generated by Stan (see files `search.R` and `search.R`)
